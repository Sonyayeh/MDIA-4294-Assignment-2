Hello Airrick,
dang it's already the last week of the semester, kinda hard to imagine the stuff we went through this sem and how everyone's managing it. For the assingment, I built on the second assignment, and added the login, log out and set up some MySQL stuff, just like you asked for. The layout of the website may be a bit different because of some coding difficulties, but the features should still be the same. I don't think there are anything you need to download specifically, only the node packages for web and api. Finally, thank you for everything and tolerate us at times, believe it or not, but I certianly will miss web scripting and second guessing about my life choices and styaing up late till 4 AM every week.
